Piracy is all about exploiting opportunities and staying one step ahead of your enemies. Secondly, you need to cultivate your reputation and build relationships with other pirates and crews. No pirate can succeed on their own, and having allies and trusted confidants can mean the difference between life and death out on the high seas. Thirdly, you have to be willing to embrace the chaos and unpredictability of the pirate life, and to roll with the punches when things don't go according to plan.

I suppose you could say that I'm a survivor at heart, always looking for a way to come out on top.
